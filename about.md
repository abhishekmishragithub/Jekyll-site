Hello, I am Abhishek from Mumbai, India. My pronouns are He/Him/His. I am working as a Developer Advocate [@Dozer](https://www.github.com/getdozer/dozer), a data API backend startup, lets you build low latency APIs in few minutes from any data source.  

I'm a backend software engineer and DevOps, an Open Source enthusiast highly driven by dev communities and proficient in Python & its application architecture. Apart from my professional work, I contribute to and run a few developer communities, some conferences across India, evangelize for OSS, and D&I in the tech community.

Side by side, I also mentor students and folks in the community. I like OSS (& communities) and doing infra <> DevOps work. I am a huge supporter of Python & the dev ecosystem around it, and I am well versed in implementing APIs (in Flask) and a bit of fronted (UI) work. I Like to read and implement more on the clean code paradigm! I love to attend conferences. Please take me along if you plan to attend one :wink:. I also contribute to dev communities - Python India - a few local chapters as well, such as [PyCon APAC](https://twitter.com/pyconapac), [PyLadies Chennai](https://chennai.pyladies.com/), and [GDG](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-chennai/) to name a few.

You can find me giving talks or hosting events in dev communities over the weekend. [Here](https://slides.com/abhishek-mishra) is a tiny slide collection of a few of my talks (shameless plug).

I am a coffee connoisseur and a big sucker of mechanical keyboards. I've spent a lot of time reading and going into a rabbit hole of Mechanical keyboards  :nerd_face:.

I also like reading (current read - Fooled by randomness), and I like philosophy & history as well. I have a wide range of tastes in music including Indian classical music. Did I mention I play Tabla (musical instrument) as well?
